                        This article seeks to explore challenges and possible solutions undergraduates face in Nigerian universities. Who will solve these problems is a matter of perspective. Steven Covey teaches that one party can create a ‘Win-Win’ situation. This is true in the sense that if the Government decides to go for a win-win, the management will cooperate because it is also a win for them. The same thing applies to the management and students’ relationship. In summary, The Government, Management, and students all have a part to play in solving or at least minimizing these challenges whether individually or cooperatively if it will be a win for all parties.

The longest was a nine months strike in 2020, followed by eight months strike in 2022. Pulse.ng states it better</p>

                        “The current labor relations paradigm in Nigeria is characterized by conflict, strikes, and other industrial disputes that harm both workers and employers.” They claim that “… a shift towards partnership, collaboration, and cooperation is necessary to create a more harmonious and productive work environment. This new paradigm emphasizes the importance of employee engagement, communication, and the recognition of the shared goals of both labor and management. Some of the potential benefits of this approach, are increased productivity, job satisfaction, and organizational effectiveness …”
